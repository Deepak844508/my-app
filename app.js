/*===>WE have to see how our project start using npm we did npm init and when we did npm init then 
 package.jason is created and package.jason file is a file for a npm configuration ,packege.jason has 
 maintais the version of the dependency but not the exact version it have a carate(^) that track the
 minor upgrade and the tild(~) which track major upgrade but it is alsways better to use ^ ,here
 we can maintains the exact version by simply removing the ^ and~ and simply use in parcel version ""
 
 And package-lock.jason contains the exact version of all the transitive or all the depedency that my 
 project will ever need,node_ modules contains all the code of it and gitignore contains all the files
 which i cannot push inside the github.
